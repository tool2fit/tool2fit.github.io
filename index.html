 <p><b>Licensing: </b> Presently, toolKaiser is running on the basic tier of the Heroku cloud service which has limited resources. As a result, the response times are slow and the service choppy. Also, their database has limited entries which means that once the database limit
  has reached, the system will stop functioning. Thus it requires constant maintenance. If you would like to have a dedicated version of toolKaiser, with fast response and smooth operation, 
  we have a licensing option available. Please email me at <b> info@toolkaiser.com </b> for more details. Thanks!</p>
