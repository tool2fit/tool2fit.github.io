<p> Email us for any issues or interest in licensing our technology at: <b> info@toolkaiser.com </b> </p>
 <p><b>Licensing: </b> Presently, toolKaiser is running on the basic tier of the Heroku cloud service which has limited resources. As a result, the response times are slow and the service choppy. Also, their database has limited entries which means that once the database limit
  has reached, the system will stop functioning. Thus, it requires constant maintenance which may result in partial or complete loss of your data. If you would like to have a dedicated version of toolKaiser, with fast response, smooth operation and unlimited data, 
  we have a licensing option available. Please email us at <b> info@toolkaiser.com </b> for more details. Thanks! Please also see our <a href="https://toolkaiser.com/end-user-license-agreement.html">End User License Agreement</a></p>
