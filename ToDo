Most important:

- now where we have multiple tool boxes we should also write them out in the saveCanvas, restoreCanvas and DFX files.

- write all DXF files for multiple tool boxes

- run things on heroku (see the mega Flask tutorial)

- work on the webpage+github to be able to run things on heroku (toolkaiser should be copied to too2fit.github.io)

- shrink the contour by some amount so that actual cutting creates snug outlines; do we need the orientation of the contour?

- best versions of shape recognizition, automatic tool placement and automatic tool detection

- order some foam from the Canada company; search for some water-jet cutting or laser cutting facility in Atlanta/Ga.Tech


Intermediate:

- allow grouping of tools and ungrouping.

- add text tags; use as default the names of files

- add notion of layer; perhaps indicate this notion by width of the line

Nice to have:

- library of known tools; e.g., all the Park bicycle tools

Bugs

- check undo/redo; it sometimes add things just to change selection label; if we could get rid of it it would be nice

- clean up tool handle icon

DONE AND FIXED:

- after you move an object it is selected even if it was not selected before; probably better not to change the status of the tool through the move

- allow "artificial objects" like circle and squares to change dimensions

- fix copy and past function on Mac

- synthetic tool resizing still seems buggy

- when we press 'backspace' to change the form field, the tool gets deleted. So we only want to trigger backspace when we are in canvas.

- write to file and read back 

- when you space the tools the order of the tools that it places
	goes by the order of the elements in the list and not where they currently are; so we should
	first figure out how they are ordered in the current setup

- undo button at least one step

- when reading back a file all tools are selected; this is due to the fact that 
when parsing the selected flag there is a problem; not clear why

- quick position of handles currently does not take the rotation and flip into account

- [3/2/2020--RU] do undo also when we create or read in objects

- [3/2/2020--RU] add keyboard shortcuts for the various operations

- [3/2/2020--SK&RU] export into dxf format or other format readable by laser cutting program

- [4/2/2020--SK&RU] implement a redo feature; not clear exactly what

- [4/2/2020--SK&RU] draw bounding boxes around selected tools

- [4/2/2020--SK&RU] align top, bottom, left and right of bounding boxes

- [5/2/2020--SK&RU]  align tool handles for selected tools

- Since we now compress the paths we show the circles around each point in the tool editor. 

- slider for showing smoothing (simplify.js)

- in the edit tool; when we delete either the first or last point (they must always be the same
in order for the path to close) then we should delete both but add as a last point a copy of what used to be the second point

- add an editor to smooth paths; this requires that we see the tools, i.e.,
have a "street view" view 

- drag a point around

- position the tool in the center and maximise the scaling 

- show selected things in blue

- multiple selections either by shift-click or ctrl-click OR by region selection

- undo and redo

- satellite view

- scaling of the tool (scale the bounding box to fit in canvas and then scale the tool appropriately)

- fix opacity label in edit tool

- vertical tool spacing (not working, but horizontal does)

- attaching new points to edit tool

- when reading in canvas the canvas is not properly sized

- make selection box by default and canvas when hold shift key as you suggested

- add a notion of material on the right

 
- add notion of of several tool boxes and be able to copy in between

- add paper size change to front page and remove from edit tool

- multiple tool box has bugs

- show the paper size for each tool

- dxf issue; just reading the file in vi and writing it back without changes fixes things

- added anchor points and distance measure to different points

- running full-pipeline via localhost server
